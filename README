## Install flatpak base images and create rpm specs and tar archives

Build the container for installing flatpak base images:

    make docker-base

Examples:

    # Check for necessary updates
    % perl scripts/flatpak-check-updates.pl

    # Install a runtime in docker environment and create tarballs under `output/`
    % scripts/flatpak-call-install.sh runtime/org.freedesktop.Sdk/x86_64/20.08
    # Create spec files from tarballs under `osc/package-name/`
    % perl scripts/flatpak-spec.pl org.freedesktop.Sdk
    # Then move the resulting files in the `osc/` directories to your osc checkout

    % scripts/flatpak-call-install.sh org.freedesktop.Platform/x86_64/20.08
    % perl scripts/flatpak-spec.pl org.freedesktop.Platform

### Requirements

* bash
* perl >= 5.22
* perl-YAML-PP
* perl-Getopt-Long-Descriptive
* perl-XML-LibXML

The flatpak commands are running in a docker container, so you only need docker
for that, but the perl scripts run on your machine.

## Build the container for building flatpak images

For trying out building apps in docker:

    make docker-builder

Note that you have to run docker with the `--privileged` option.
